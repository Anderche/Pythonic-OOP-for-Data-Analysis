# **Pythonic OOP for Data Analysis**
## **Paystub Calculator Program**

BACKGROUND:
The following Python prompts a User to input their name, employee no., week-end-date, hours worked, pay rate, as well as standard and overtime tax percentage rates. This data is then used to calculate the employee's gross pay, tax deductions, and lastly net pay (with the assumption that the work week is 37.5 hours).

e.g. A User must enter the following data:
- Employee Name (sample input – Mark Bate)
- Employee Number
- Week Ending
- Number of hours worked
- Hourly Rate
- Overtime Rate
- Standard Tax Rate 
- Overtime Tax Rate
– Mark Rate

Once the above data has been entered the program should display the employee’s paystub.
